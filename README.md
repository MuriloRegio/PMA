# parallelizationMetricsAnalysis

This project aims to provide a easy way to extract the execution information from a parallel program when the same is ran with different amount of threads.
The extracted information can also be used to build a efficiency graph to show the relationship between the number of threads and the relative efficiency and speed-up (compared to the non-parallel execution).
